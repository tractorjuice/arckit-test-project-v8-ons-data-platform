## [0.8.2] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **Dependency Matrix Accuracy**: Corrected 4 critical (M-level) dependency errors
  - `dos` now correctly requires principles (M) - ensures evaluation framework aligned with architecture governance
  - `evaluate` now correctly requires principles (M) - ensures vendor scoring criteria match organizational standards
  - `hld-review` now correctly requires principles (M) - validates design decisions against documented principles
  - `dld-review` now correctly requires principles (M) - ensures implementation adheres to architectural standards

- **High-Priority Dependencies**: Added 9 recommended (R-level) dependencies to improve quality
  - `plan` now recommends stakeholders (R), requirements (R), principles (R), sobc (R), risk (R) - creates realistic timelines based on project scope
  - `principles` now recommends gcloud-search (R) for G-Cloud procurement - ensures search criteria align with principles
  - `stakeholders` now recommends research (R), dos (R) - better procurement strategy and vendor requirements
  - `data-model` now recommends research (R) - data modeling informed by vendor research and technology choices
  - `service-assessment` now recommends plan (R) - validates timelines and delivery approach

- **Artifact Summary Counts**: Corrected consumer counts in dependency matrix
  - `principles.md` consumer count: 10 → 14 commands (added dos, gcloud-search, service-assessment)
  - `stakeholders.md` consumer count: 7 → 9 commands (added research, dos, service-assessment)

### Added

- **Comprehensive Dependency Documentation** (3 new documents):
  - `DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md` (191 lines) - 28×28 Dependency Structure Matrix showing all command dependencies
    - Matrix legend (M=Mandatory, R=Recommended, O=Optional)
    - 10-tier dependency hierarchy (Tier 0: Foundation → Tier 10: Compliance)
    - 5 critical paths (Standard, UK Gov, UK Gov AI, MOD Defence, MOD Defence AI)
    - Artifact fan-in/fan-out analysis (requirements.md consumed by 22 commands)
    - Design notes explaining dependency rationale
    - All critical and high-priority dependencies implemented (Phase 1-2 complete)
  - `WORKFLOW-DIAGRAMS.md` (431 lines) - Visual workflow diagrams for all 5 project paths
    - Mermaid flowcharts showing decision gates and command flows
    - Standard Project workflow (12 steps)
    - UK Government Project workflow (16 steps)
    - UK Government AI Project workflow (15 steps)
    - MOD Defence Project workflow (16 steps)
    - MOD Defence AI Project workflow (17 steps)

### Changed

- **Command Template Enforcement**: Updated 4 command templates to enforce critical dependencies
  - `.claude/commands/arckit.dos.md` - Added principles (M) check with guidance
  - `.claude/commands/arckit.evaluate.md` - Added principles (M) check with guidance
  - `.claude/commands/arckit.hld-review.md` - Added principles (M) check with guidance
  - `.claude/commands/arckit.dld-review.md` - Added principles (M) check with guidance

### Why This Matters

The dependency matrix work ensures ArcKit commands are executed in the correct order, preventing:
- **Quality Issues**: Running evaluate without principles means vendor scoring isn't aligned with organizational standards
- **Rework**: Running hld-review/dld-review without principles means design decisions may violate governance
- **Incomplete Analysis**: Running plan without requirements means timelines don't reflect actual scope
- **Procurement Failures**: Running dos without stakeholders means vendor requirements don't address real needs

The comprehensive dependency documentation provides:
- **Clear Guidance**: 5 workflow diagrams showing exactly which commands to run for different project types
- **Traceability**: Complete dependency chain from foundation commands to final compliance assessments
- **Quality Assurance**: Artifact fan-in analysis shows requirements.md consumed by 22 commands (highest)

This release completes the dependency analysis initiative (Issue #9) with:
- Phase 1: 4 critical (M-level) fixes ✅
- Phase 2: 9 high-priority (R-level) enhancements ✅
- Phase 3: 26 optional (O-level) enhancements (future work)

### Why This Matters

JSP 936 (Dependable Artificial Intelligence in Defence), published November 2024, establishes the UK Ministry of Defence's mandatory framework for safe and responsible adoption of AI/ML systems. Defence projects using AI must complete JSP 936 assessments to receive approval at the appropriate level (2PUS/Ministerial for Critical, Defence-Level for Severe/Major, TLB-Level for Moderate/Minor).

Without JSP 936 compliance, defence AI projects face:
- Approval blockages (no deployment without JSP 936 assessment)
- Ethical risks unidentified until late stages
- Unclear accountability for AI decisions
- Inadequate bias testing and harm mitigation
- Missing security controls for AI-specific threats
- No continuous monitoring or drift detection

The `/arckit.jsp-936` command automates the creation of comprehensive JSP 936 compliance documentation, guiding project teams through:
- Systematic identification of all AI/ML components
- Ethical risk classification using MOD's likelihood × impact methodology
- Assessment against all 5 ethical principles (Human-Centricity, Responsibility, Understanding, Bias & Harm Mitigation, Reliability)
- Documentation for all 8 AI lifecycle phases
- Human-AI teaming strategy design
- AI-specific security threat assessment
- Continuous monitoring and re-assessment planning

This command ensures MOD AI projects have the documentation required for approval while embedding best practices for responsible AI throughout the lifecycle.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added

- **`/arckit.backlog` command**: Product backlog generation from ArcKit artifacts
  - Automatically converts requirements to GDS-format user stories ("As a... I want... So that...")
  - Multi-factor prioritization (MoSCoW + risk + value + dependencies)
  - Groups stories into epics (from Business Requirements)
  - Generates technical tasks from NFRs and infrastructure needs

  - Exports to multiple formats: markdown, CSV (Jira/Azure DevOps), JSON (API integration)
  - Time savings: 75%+ reduction (4-6 weeks manual → 3-5 days)
  - Output: `projects/{project-dir}/backlog.md` (+ optional CSV/JSON)

- **docs/guides/backlog.md**: Comprehensive 700+ line guide
  - GDS user story format and best practices

### Changed

- **Command count**: 26 → 27 commands
- **README.md**: Added `/arckit.backlog` as Phase 10 (Sprint Planning), renumbered subsequent phases
- **docs/index.html**: To be updated with backlog command in phase sections
- **Version**: Updated from v0.5.0 to v0.6.0 across all files

### Why This Matters

Product backlog creation is one of the most time-consuming tasks when transitioning from design (Alpha) to implementation (Beta). Teams spend 4-6 weeks manually converting requirements into user stories, estimating effort, prioritising work, and organising into sprints. This command automates that process in minutes, saving 75%+ of the time while maintaining GDS compliance and best practices.

The backlog command bridges the gap between ArcKit's design phase commands (`/arckit.requirements`, `/arckit.hld`) and implementation, providing a sprint-ready backlog that development teams can immediately use for sprint planning.
