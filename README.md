## Why ArcKit?

### Problem: Architecture Governance is Broken

Traditional enterprise architecture suffers from:
- ❌ Scattered documents across tools (Word, Confluence, PowerPoint)
- ❌ Inconsistent governance enforcement
- ❌ Manual vendor evaluation with bias
- ❌ Lost traceability between requirements and design
- ❌ Stale documentation that doesn't match reality

### Solution: Structured, AI-Assisted Governance

ArcKit provides:
- ✅ **Template-Driven Quality**: Comprehensive templates ensure nothing is forgotten
- ✅ **Systematic Workflows**: Clear processes from requirements → procurement → design review
- ✅ **AI Assistance**: Let AI handle document generation, you focus on decisions
- ✅ **Enforced Traceability**: Automatic gap detection and coverage analysis
- ✅ **Version Control**: Git-based workflow for all architecture artifacts

## Wardley Mapping for Strategic Architecture

ArcKit uses Wardley Maps to expose the strategic position of every component before you commit to a solution. The `/arckit.wardley` command produces ready-to-visualise maps that:
- Trace user needs through the supporting value chain so gaps and duplicated effort are obvious.
- Plot evolution from Genesis → Commodity to reveal when to build, buy, reuse, or retire capabilities.
- Feed procurement, vendor evaluation, and design reviews with shared situational awareness.

Maps are emitted in the Open Wardley Map format — paste them straight into [https://create.wardleymaps.ai](https://create.wardleymaps.ai) for a visual view. Full example outputs live in the public demos such as `arckit-test-project-v1-m365` (cloud migration strategy) and `arckit-test-project-v8-cabinet-office-genai` (cross-government GenAI platform).

## Architecture Diagrams with Mermaid

**ArcKit generates visual architecture diagrams using Mermaid for clear technical communication.**

### What are Architecture Diagrams?

Architecture diagrams visualize system structure, interactions, and deployment for:
- **Technical Communication**: Share architecture with stakeholders
- **Design Documentation**: Document current and future state
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Compare vendor technical approaches
- **UK Government Compliance**: Visualize Cloud First, GOV.UK services, PII handling

### Diagram Types

ArcKit supports 6 essential diagram types based on the C4 Model and enterprise architecture best practices:

| Diagram Type | Level | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **C4 Context** | Level 1 | System in context with users and external systems | After requirements, to show system boundaries |
| **C4 Container** | Level 2 | Technical containers and technology choices | After HLD, for vendor review |
| **C4 Component** | Level 3 | Internal components within a container | After DLD, for implementation |
| **Deployment** | Infrastructure | Cloud resources and network topology | Cloud First compliance, cost estimation |
| **Sequence** | Interaction | API flows and request/response patterns | Integration requirements, API design |
| **Data Flow** | Data | How data moves, PII handling, GDPR compliance | UK GDPR, DPIA requirements |

Use `/arckit.diagram` directly, or supply an explicit type such as `context`, `container`, `sequence`, or `dataflow`. Outputs bundle component inventories with Wardley evolution tags, built-in GOV.UK compliance scaffolding (Notify, Pay, Design System), Cloud First network patterns, GDPR annotations, and traceability back to requirements and tests. For full examples, browse the diagram folders in `arckit-test-project-v2-hmrc-chatbot` and `arckit-test-project-v6-patent-system`.

## ServiceNow Service Management Design

ArcKit turns architecture artefacts into an operations-ready ServiceNow pack. The `/arckit.servicenow` command builds:
- CMDB hierarchies, SLAs, and change risk straight from requirements, diagrams, and Wardley Maps.
- ITIL-aligned runbooks covering incident, change, monitoring, and transition activities.
- UK government extras such as GDS Service Standard, Technology Code of Practice, and GOV.UK Pay/Notify dependencies when relevant.

For full outputs, explore the public demos (for example `arckit-test-project-v7-nhs-appointment` and `arckit-test-project-v1-m365`) where the generated ServiceNow design files and checklists are published end-to-end.

## Relationship to Spec Kit

ArcKit is inspired by [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) but targets a different audience:

| | Spec Kit | ArcKit |
|---|----------|--------|
| **Audience** | Product Managers, Developers | Enterprise Architects, Procurement |
| **Focus** | Feature development (0→1 code generation) | Architecture governance & vendor management |
| **Workflow** | Spec → Plan → Tasks → Code | Requirements → RFP → Design Review → Traceability |
| **Output** | Working code | Architecture documentation & governance |

## Troubleshooting

### Token Limit Error

If you see: `API Error: Claude's response exceeded the 32000 output token maximum`

**The Problem**: ArcKit generates large documents that can exceed Claude's 32K token output limit.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Your Claude subscription plan determines the maximum tokens:
- 🔴 Free/Pro plans: **32K max** (cannot be increased)
- ✅ Team/Enterprise plans: Can increase to 64K via environment variable

**Solutions**:

1. **For Team/Enterprise plans** - Increase token limit:
   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000
   ```

2. **For ALL plans** (including Free/Pro) - Use **Write tool strategy**:
   ```
   User: /arckit.requirements but write directly to file using Write tool, show me only a summary
   ```

   This tells Claude to use the Write tool to create the file (doesn't count toward output tokens) and only show you a summary.

**Which commands are affected?**
- 🔴 HIGH RISK: `/arckit.research`, `/arckit.sobc`, `/arckit.requirements`, `/arckit.data-model`, `/arckit.sow`
- 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: `/arckit.risk`, `/arckit.evaluation`, `/arckit.principles`

**See full guide**: [docs/TOKEN-LIMITS.md](docs/TOKEN-LIMITS.md)

### Common Issues

**Command not found**: Ensure Claude Code is installed and commands are loaded
```bash
# Check if .claude/commands/ directory exists
ls .claude/commands/
```

**Template not found**: Ensure you've run `/arckit.principles` first
```bash
# Check if templates exist
ls templates/
```

**Project creation fails**: Ensure you have an ArcKit repository initialized
```bash
# Initialize if needed
arckit init .
```
